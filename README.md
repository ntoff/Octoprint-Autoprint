# Autoprint

Upon uploading a file to octoprint, this plugin will _immediately_ start to print it __without any sort of warning or confirmation.__

## DO NOT FORGET YOU HAVE IT ENABLED!

I will provide no install instructions for this plugin as an added safety measure against somehow accidentally installing it, enabling it, and forgetting it's there and then complaining your printer somehow magically started up "all by itself".

### Disclaimer:

_This plugin will not confirm before printing, it will never ask whether you wish to start a print, therefore it is up to YOU as the printer operator and maintainer to ensure the print bed is free from previous prints, children and pets are clear, and the printer is in working condition __before__ uploading a file._

_I will not be held responsible for any damages or injuries arising from the incorrect use of this plugin. Always be sure your print settings are correct before uploading, filament is loaded and the correct type, the print area is clear of obstructions, and your gcode has been previewed and determined to be fit for purpose._

___DO NOT INSTALL THIS PLUGIN ON A PRINTER TO WHICH YOU DO NOT HAVE SOLE ACCESS TO, AND TOTAL CONTROL OVER.___
