# Autoprint

Upon uploading a file to octoprint, this plugin will _immediately_ start to print it without any sort of warning or confirmation.

## DO NOT FORGET YOU HAVE IT ENABLED!

I will provide no install instructions for this plugin as an added safety measure against somehow accidentally installing it, enabling it, and forgetting it's there and then complaining your printer somehow magically started up "all by itself".
